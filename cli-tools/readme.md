# CLI-Tools Tips

Some tips on using the CLI tools

## bat

Bat can stand in for the cat command, with added features like syntax highlighting, git integration,
and automatic paging. Bat leverages the popular Rust library `syntect` for syntax highlighting
using Sublime Text syntax definitions.

## ripgrep

ripgrep is a command line tool that searches your files for patterns that you give it. ripgrep
behaves as if reading each file line by line. If a line matches the pattern provided to ripgrep,
then that line will be printed. If a line does not match the pattern, then the line is
not printed.

Debian: `sudo apt-get install ripgrep`

## exa

`exa` is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. 
And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.

for debian: `apt install exa`

```bash
# command to run exa with some useful options:
exa -abghli
```

May also want to set an alias for this command
